                        <li>The bar needs a site to check hours and events. They currently rely on Facebook and review sites but all the info needs to be pooled in one place to ensure ownership and accuracy.</li>
                        <li>Menu and ordering options for inside restaurant (Garzon Latinx Street Food).</li>
                        <li>Share photos and engage in social media.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The Facebook and review sites are disjointed and it is unclear if hours or menus are up-to-date. A central authoritative site will provide a central source.</li>
                        <li>Having a separately owned restaurant inside is unique. The site can emphasize this relationship and link to the restaurant. Locals may be more familiar with Black Cat and think of it as the original destination. They serve authentic Latinx "street food" and this association will add appeal to the bar.</li>
                        <li>The restaurant has its own (well-designed) website that offers menus and online ordering. There is no need to build out this functionality. The well-designed site will be a positive association.</li>
                        <li>In the future, the bar site can provide statistics on how often it drives traffic to the restaurant.</li>
                        <li>The atmosphere of the bar is very relaxed and has a cool vibe with hip locals. The site should be heavy on photos to emphasize this style which will increase affinity of locals.</li>
                        <li>Links to Instagram or even a photo gallery will be fun and increase loyalty.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>There is overlap with the "locals" audience; the same need applies for a central and authoritative site for hours and directions. Parking options will also be important for this audience (they don't have their own parking).</li>
                        <li>The overall web presence needs to be enhanced to attract folks that are out for the evening/weekend or on vacation/traveling. This audience will most likely be using Google Maps search which returns a large number of similar results and includes a link to the website.</li>
                        <li>The style of the website needs to showcase the atmosphere of the bar so that it will attract people that share the same aesthetic taste and social environment.</li>
                        <li>As a casual neighborhood bar, it will emphasize reasonable drink prices rather than expensive gimmicky drinks.</li>
                        <li>This audience will likely be looking for dinner options and having a site that directly links the bar to the Garzon Latinx Street Food restaurant will drive traffic.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Having well laid out hours, menu, and directions will decrease the number of phone calls so that the employees can focus on running the bar.</li>
                        <li>The ability to post and share photos either in a gallery or via Instagram or other social media will create comradery between the staff and also local regulars. They do not do a great amount of this right now, so basic functionality will serve for the time being.</li>
                        <li>The bar does not host a large number of events so a simple event manager directly on the home page will be sufficient. The events they do have are fairly static (e.g. they used to host a chess night every Wednesday) and will not require as much maintenance as a bar that books live music, etc...</li>
                        <li>They have been featured several times in the paper and online articles. Having an aside section can showcase this attention without overpowering the vibe of the site.</li>
